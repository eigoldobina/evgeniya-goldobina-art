    <p>
        My name is Evgeniya Goldobina. I was born and raised in Russia, but the Pacific Northwest has become
        the place that truly feels like home. I live in Mukilteo, WA with my family, surrounded by the quiet
        coastal light and forests that inspire much of my work.
    </p>

        Art has always been a part of my life—I attended art school as a child and teen, but adulthood took
        me in a different direction. Still, I always longed to return to painting. During the pandemic, I finally
        paused long enough to pick up my brushes again, and I fell completely in love. Painting became my safe
        space, a place where I can relax, disconnect, and immerse myself in my own world.

        Over the 15 years I’ve lived in the U.S., I’ve also spent meaningful time in Hawai‘i—especially on the
        Big Island—and its colors and atmosphere continue to influence my palette. Today I work primarily in
        gouache, acrylic, and oil, creating atmospheric landscapes inspired by the Pacific Northwest, Hawai‘i,
        and the emotional connection I have with these places.

        I don't enter a lot of art competitions and shows but some of my artwork has received regional and
        national recognition. In 2025, I earned Second Place in the Small Artwork category at the Edmonds Art Festival
        and Second Place in the Northwind Fine Arts Gallery Annual Show in New York. 
        I was a finalist in Acrylic Works 11 (September 2024 issue), and my painting was selected among the Top 20
        finalists in the Modern Impressionist Journal February/March 2024 competition.
        I am a member of PAWA — Plein Air Washington Artists, participating in events and exhibitions
        that celebrate outdoor painting across the state.
